# odin-recipes

This is site is going to be a basic recipe website. It will link to several recipes and will be made with basic html and css. I am going to try to practice good design principles and make the website look good with basic css. 

I am making this after having self taught React, Laravel, Inertia stack but this is a good way to go back to basics to understand what I am doing in the framework I learned.
