                Dim Sum is a staple of Southeastern Chinese food specifically Guangdong.
                As a son of an immigrant from Guangzhou I have many memories of going to 
                Flushing to have dim sum with extended family on many weekends. The steamed 
                spare ribs is one of the quintessential items that I always had and looked forward to.

                The thing is with these ribs is that it is so easy to make. All it takes is marinating
                the ribs and putting it into a steamer and you'll have delicious ribs in no time.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Cut the pork into bite-sized pieces. The key is to cut in the space between the bones.
                    you will have some larger and some smaller pieces depending on the ribs you got.
                    <strong>Note:</strong> You can get the right ribs from a Chinese supermarket or you can ask your butcher to cut
                    a rack lengthwise. The bones should be around 1" wide.
